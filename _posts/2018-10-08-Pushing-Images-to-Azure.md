Weldr aka. Composer can generate images suitable for uploading to the Azure
cloud, and running an instance there. The images have the right format, and
include the necessary agents, as well as
[cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Prerequisites

We'll use [Fedora 29](https://getfedora.org/) as our OS of choice for running this. Run
this in its own VM with at least 8 gigabytes of memory and 40 gigabytes of disk space.
[Lorax](http://weldr.io/lorax/) makes some changes to the operating system its running on.

First install Composer:

    $ sudo yum install lorax-composer cockpit-composer cockpit composer-cli

Next make sure to turn off [SELinux](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/deployment_guide/ch-selinux) on the system. Lorax doesn't yet work properly with
SELinux running, as it installs an entire OS image in an alternate directory:

    $ sudo setenforce 0
    $ sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config

Now start ```lorax-composer``` system service:

    $ sudo systemctl enable --now lorax-composer.socket

If you're going to use [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) UI to drive Composer
(see below), you can also enable it like this:

    $ sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit && firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent

Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-yum) tooling:

    $ sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
    $ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[azure-cli]\nname=Azure CLI\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/azure-cli\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/yum.repos.d/azure-cli.repo'
    $ sudo yum install azure-cli

Now log into the Azure CLI like so:

    $ az login
    To sign in, use a web browser to open the page
    https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code XXXXXXXXX to authenticate.
    ...

Make sure you have an appropriate *resource group* created in Azure. The one I'm using
is called ```composer```. Make sure you also have an appropriate storage account
created in Azure. The one I'm using is called ```composerredhat```. Next list the keys
for that storage account:

    $ GROUP=composer
    $ ACCOUNT=composerredhat
    $ az storage account keys list --resource-group $GROUP --account-name $ACCOUNT

Make note of ```"key1"``` in the above output, and assign it to an environment variable:

    $ KEY1=....................

Lastly create an appropriate storage container:

    $ CONTAINER=composerredhat
    $ az storage container create --account-name $ACCOUNT --account-key $KEY1 --name $CONTAINER

## Compose an image from the UI

To compose an image in Composer, log into the *Cockpit Web Console* with your web browser.
It's running on port ```9090``` on the VM that you're running Composer in. Use any admin
or ```root``` Linux system credentials to log in.  Select the *Image Builder* tab.

![Cockpit Composer](/images/cockpit-composer-main.png)

We first have to have a *blueprint* defined. This blueprint describes what goes into the image.
For the purposes of this example we'll use the ```example-http-server``` blueprint, which
builds an image that contains a basic HTTP server.

Click on the *Create Image* button and choose *Azure* from the dropdown
to choose the *Image Type*:

![Create Image AMI](/images/cockpit-composer-azure-create.png)

If you click on the blueprint, you should see progress described on the Images tab:

![Create Image Progress](/images/cockpit-composer-azure-progress.png)

Once it's done, download the image.

## Compose an image from the CLI

To compose an image in Composer from the command line, we first have to have a *blueprint*
defined. This blueprint describes what goes into the image. For the purposes of this
example we'll use the ```example-http-server``` blueprint, which builds an image that
contains a basic HTTP server.

We run the following command to start a compose. Notice that we pass the image type
of ```vhd``` which indicates we want an image appropriate for pushing to
*Azure* in the *Virtual Hard Disk* format.

    $ sudo composer-cli compose start example-http-server vhd
    Compose 25ccb8dd-3872-477f-9e3d-c2970cd4bbaf added to the queue

Now check the status of the compose like this:

    $ sudo composer-cli compose status
    25ccb8dd-3872-477f-9e3d-c2970cd4bbaf RUNNING  Mon Oct  8 09:45:52 2018 example-http-server 0.0.1 vhd

In order to diagnose a failure or look for more detailed progress, see:

    $ sudo journalctl -fu lorax-composer
    ...

When it's done you can download the resulting image into the current directory:

    $ sudo composer-cli compose image 25ccb8dd-3872-477f-9e3d-c2970cd4bbaf
    25ccb8dd-3872-477f-9e3d-c2970cd4bbaf-disk.vhd: 4460.00 MB

## Pushing and using the image

So now you have an image created by Composer, and sitting in the current working directory.
Here's how you push it to *Azure* and create an instance from it:

    $ VHD=25ccb8dd-3872-477f-9e3d-c2970cd4bbaf-disk.vhd
    $ az storage blob upload --account-name $ACCOUNT --container-name $CONTAINER --file $VHD --name $VHD --type page
    Alive[#####                                                           ]  9.1480%
    ...

Once the upload to the *Azure BLOB* completes, we can create an Azure image from it:

    $ az image create --resource-group $GROUP --name $VHD --os-type linux --location eastus --source https://$ACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net/$CONTAINER/$VHD
     - Running ...

Next create an instance either with the Azure portal, or a command similar to the following:

    $ az vm create --resource-group $GROUP --location eastus --name $VHD --image $VHD --admin-username azure-user --generate-ssh-keys
     - Running ...

Private SSH keys will be written to your home directory under ```~/.ssh```. If you do not have
any existing SSH keys, they will become your default SSH keys. The above command will print out
an IP address to access the VM. The user to log in as is ```azure-user```

    $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa azure-user@40.76.0.100
